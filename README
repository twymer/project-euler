My files from doing Project Euler. A lot of the Python files are several years old so might be poor attempts or style. Some files have been lost sadly.

Python solutions were never revised after completion so are pretty "uncut". Ruby solutions up to ~#30 were me redoing previously solved questions to attempt to find proper Ruby-like solutions.
