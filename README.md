Project Euler solutions
---

Most of Python solutions were from my college era and were never revised after completion. These are probably pretty ugly and generally "uncut".

Ruby solutions up to ~#30 were me redoing previously solved questions to attempt to find proper Ruby-like solutions.

Some files have been lost sadly.
